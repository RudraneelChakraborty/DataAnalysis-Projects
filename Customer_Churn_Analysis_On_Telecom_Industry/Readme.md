# Customer Churn analysis in the telecom industry

The proposed Application is used to develop a model for customer churn analysis in the telecom industry. With the sample data, we will make the machine learn.
With the rapid development of communication technology, the field of telecommunication faces complex challenges due to the number of vibrant competitive service providers. Customer Churn is a major issue that faces the Telecommunication industries in the world. Churn is the activity of customers leaving the company and discarding the services offered by it, due to dissatisfaction with the provided services.

To minimize customer churn, prediction activity is an important part of the telecommunication industryâ€™s vital decision-making and strategic planning process.

The model designed will be helping the companies to escape customer churn problems with respect to the input features in the model. It is for that; telecommunication companies realize that keeping existing customers is getting more important and agree that churn analysis is one of the important data mining application areas. Churn Analysis is applied to research why customers switch service providers.
