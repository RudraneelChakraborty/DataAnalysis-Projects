# Finance Data Project

This data project is focused on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. Keep in mind, this project is just meant to practice visualization and pandas skills, it is not meant to be a robust financial analysis or be taken as financial advice.

We'll focus on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the financial crisis all the way to early 2016.

__This project used the Pandas-Datareader library to get stock information for the following banks:__

* Bank of America
* CitiGroup
* Goldman Sachs
* JPMorgan Chase
* Morgan Stanley
* Wells Fargo

The Financial Stock Market values for a stock depend on public sentiment as well as the Condition of the Financial Market for that year.
From December 2007 to June 2009, The Great Recession happened in the US, which resulted in stock value crashes. Here to analyze the 
financial stock data we took 6 Bank Stocks and will check how that was react though out the Years.

And will make a Decision out of that, If the Stock Market is really dependent on Public Sentiment or Market/ Financial Condition or not.
