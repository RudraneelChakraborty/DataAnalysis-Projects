# Finance Data Project

In this data project, we will focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. Keep in mind, this project is just meant to practice visualization and pandas skills, it is not meant to be a robust financial analysis or be taken as financial advice.

We'll focus on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the financial crisis all the way to early 2016.

__This project used the Pandas-Datareader library to get stock information for the following banks:__

* Bank of America
* CitiGroup
* Goldman Sachs
* JPMorgan Chase
* Morgan Stanley
* Wells Fargo
